        <h2 class="heading2">Dosa</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Dosa is a popular South Indian breakfast crepe made from lentils and rice. Coconut and/or ginger chutney as a side adds spice. Eating with lentil soup and fry made from mixed veg curry especially potato/carrot/peas/onion makes it more rich in taste as well as calories. It can be served not only for breakfast but for lunch or dinner as well. <br><br>
        Other popular breakfast items are idli, vada (deep fried spicy doughnut), moongdal crepe with upma, and puri with aloo curry. All of the above ones are a great choice for vegetarians. They provide an appropriate balance in carbohydrate/protein ratio.
